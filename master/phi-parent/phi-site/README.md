Getting Started

To run the project, you'll require maven, java and postgres to be installed. 

The site runs on a community edition of Magnolia CMS (http://www.magnolia-cms.com/). 
Magnolia is provided as an external dependency that is overlayed with multiple artifacts.

#
#Step 1. Install your environment
#
#
Install Maven ( 3.2.1 will do the job ), Java ( use 1.8 ) and Postgres ( 9.3 will do the job ). 

#
# Step 2. Set up the database
# 
#
Create a Postgres database ( call it magnolia_author ) and user ( magnolia_author and password magnolia_author ). 
Grant all privileges to the user.
